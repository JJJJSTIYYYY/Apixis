    present in state is initialized directly from the update value.

    This class contains no runtime data. It is metadata collected by

    When a marked field is copied, the graph keeps the original field value's
    reference instead of creating a copied object. Other state fields continue
    to follow the normal copy behavior.

    This is useful for fields that represent shared runtime resources or
    mutable objects that should remain synchronized across copied states.

    !!! Warning:
        Fields marked with ``KeepRef`` are not recommended for concurrent use.
        Since copied states share the same object reference, concurrent graph
        executions or parallel node operations may access and mutate the same
        object, causing unexpected side effects or race conditions.
        Additionally, it is also not recommended to update the key marked with
        ``KeepRef`` via Command. **This may lead to unpredictable behavior.**
